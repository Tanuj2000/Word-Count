The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using 
simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather
than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering 
a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

As the World Wide Web grew in the late 1900s and early 2000s, search engines and indexes were created to help locate relevant information amid the 
text-based content. In the early years, search results were returned by humans. But as the web grew from dozens to millions of pages, automation was 
needed. Web crawlers were created, many as university-led research projects, and search engine start-ups took off (Yahoo, AltaVista, etc.).
